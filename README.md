# Fusion360 and ANSYS CFD Designs

This repository contains my design files created using Fusion360 and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations conducted on ANSYS.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Fusion360/`: This directory contains all my 3D design files created using Fusion360.
- `ANSYS_CFD/`: This directory contains all my CFD simulation files from ANSYS.

## Fusion360 Designs

In the Fusion360 directory, you will find my 3D modeling designs. Each design is saved in its own folder along with relevant details and version history.

## ANSYS CFD Simulations

In the ANSYS_CFD directory, you will find the setup and results of my CFD simulations. Each simulation is stored in its own folder with all associated files and a brief description of the simulation scenario.

## Software

The designs and simulations in this repository were created using the following software:

- Fusion360
- ANSYS

Please ensure you have the correct software installed to open and view the files.

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the designs and simulations, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
